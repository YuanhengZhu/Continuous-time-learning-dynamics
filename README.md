# Continuous-time-learning-dynamics

This project includes the MATLAB code of continuous-time learning dynamics proposed in paper "Empirical Policy Optimization for n-Player Markov Games"

Two numerical Markov games are presented: two-player Soccer game and three-player Cournot Competition

You can see how the algorithm works by running sg_ctld.m and tfcc_ctld_6.m

If you find the algorithm useful, please don't forget to cite the following work: <br>
